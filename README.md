# IDS-Security-Onion-Project

Final Project for UIW Intrusion Detection Systems. By **Anthony Jamieson** and **Abdul Alqarni**.

# Summary

We will work with a deployment of Security Onion to log the details of a simulated attack on a vulnerable system through PCAP data. As a team we will perform our own attack on vulnerable virtual machines and capture the PCAP of our attack for use with Security Onion. We will take the logs and filter the data to display in an executive report. Through this project, we will gain knowledge in logging, cyberattack red flags, and SIEM integration.
